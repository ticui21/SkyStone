## Welcome!

This module contains the source files for `Trobot`, the custom library written by and for FTC team
#8696 Trobotix. It was started at the beginning of the 2019-2020 season (SkyStone), but unfortunately
was not implemented at the time. However, `Trobot` is recieving major upgrades during the off-season
of the summer of 2020 and will hopefully be implemented for the 2020-2021 season and beyond.

## Trobot

`Trobot` is a composition of two parts: `Drivetrain` and `Component`
